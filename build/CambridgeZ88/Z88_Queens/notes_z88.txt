                   NOTES FOR THE CAMBRIDGE Z88 VERSION OF

                           THE QUEEN'S FOOTSTEPS

                                Davide Bucci


This version of the game runs on the Cambridge Z88. Three different formats are
provided:

- .epr file images containing applications, to be used with emulators.
- .app and .apX files, as RAM-installable applications.
- .BAS files, to be loaded in the BBC basic.

Use the format that is most convenient for you!

This port has been made possible by Dom and the awesome z88dk compiler.
Many thanks to Jamie, for the useful feedback and the adaptation of the splash
screen, too!
