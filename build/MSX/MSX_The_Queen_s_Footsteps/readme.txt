"Today is August 27th, 1904. Nine months ago, you, Emilia  Vittorini, joined the
Italian Archeological Expedition in Egypt led by Ernesto Schiaparelli, the
director of the Egyptian Museum of Turin. You are now back in Genoa, Italy: your
steam ferry arrived three days ago with 25 wooden boxes containing Queen
Nefertari Meritmut's grave goods, a real treasure! They left Genoa by train,
heading towards Turin, yesterday evening. While they were in transit, you were
invited to a sumptuous reception organised by a wealthy art lover, Eugenio
Collovati, count of Raligotto, but it would be hard to say that you appreciated 
the evening.

But the reception was yesterday: now, you must catch the train to Turin and 
check that the treasure arrived safely. I will be your eyes and ears. Good 
luck."

This version contains the game split into three separate parts.
To unlock the second part you should have played the first one and type the
appropriate password at the beginning of the game. Same for the third one.

This is a text adventure game. Read descriptions carefully and type commands 
such as 'examine bed'. Type "north", "south", ... to move in the desired 
direction.. Abbreviations are possible "x" for "examine", "l" to "look" (i.e. 
describe your current location again), "i" for "inventory," "n" for "north" and
so on. To quit the game, type "bye". To restart it, type "restart".

The game can not be saved and loaded, so write down your passwords!

You find in the archive the three parts distributed in different forms:

- .cas files complete with a loader showing a graphic splash screen
- .rom files (to be loaded from address 0x4000)
- .cas files without the loader and the splash screen
- a single .cas file that contains the loader followed by the three parts of
  the game.
