A considerable number of steps climb to the Tempietto (small temple), on the top of the Mole Antonelliana building. It has been damaged by the recent storm, but the view on the Alps is just breathtaking. Some girders and metallic plates are there because of the work in progress.

The journey from Genoa to Turin took six hours and you slept for a while. You spent the rest of the time watching the landscape fleeing outside the window of your compartment, lost in your thoughts, until the train arrived at the Porta Nuova station, in Turin. You walked towards your home, to meet your father and your cat (the latter hungry, as usual). They were enthusiastic to meet you again, but you are not resting for a long time: you are now determined to find Rovelli and decipher the letter you discovered in Genoa.

MESSAGGI

It's a sort of puzzle, but you are good at those things: you used the gum paper to hold the pieces together and it works. The letter is now readable, and says, "Turin, August 20, 1904. Dear Rovelli, 88 43 23..." and a series of numbers. It's a code! This sounds weird... The letter is signed "The Grand Master" followed a symbol with an O and a wavy sign, a sort of an S inside.
108
Use 'bye' if you want to stop playing.
231
You may try that, but it will probably not work.
232
You caress Democrito, your cat. He seems enthusiastic to see you!
233
He's your pet, a Siamese tabby mix and is extremely gentle. He is a relatively small cat, but with soft long hair.
234
Your father is a middle-aged man, relatively tall and with bright eyes.  Ten years ago with his brother he founded a steam car company, called ITA, i.e. Industria Torinese Automobili. He is a mechanical genius and a cultivated man.
235
You cheer up Temistocle. He's prickly to strangers, but he knows you well: ^M- Ah, Emilia, you came back! Come with me, Director Schiaparelli is so worried.^MYou follow him and he lets you in to Schiaparelli's office. He is working at his desk: ^M- Oh, good grief, my dear Emilia, the sandals are the most important finding of the grave...^M^MYou have a long talk. Schiaparelli suspects the freight company and in particular Rovelli.^M^M- Maybe we can find the sandals in the art market. They are extremely valuable! You can ask Vittorio Pizzarrotti about that: he lives in a villa on the hill of Turin and he is an art dealer and a patron of considerable renown. Here's his calling card.
236
You show the letter to your father. He says, "It's a code! Go see Antonia Rivetti, you remember her? She now works at the Accademia Albertina; she will be glad to help you."
237
No reason to do that.
238
You knock on the door and enter Antonia's office.^M^M- Madam, I'm Emilia Vittorini.^M- Emilia? Last time I saw you you were a kid. What brings you here?^M^MYou explain briefly the situation and show her the letter.^M^M- Aha! A cipher-book code. You need a book and you number each word progressively. You then associate a progressive number to the first letter of each word and you use that to encode your text. You need to know the book used for that, it's the key. The symbol on the other hand reminds me of something... I'll do some research and I'll let you know.^M^MYou thank her warmly and you continue chatting for a while!
239
Antonia is about 40 year old: she is a true beauty, just as you remembered. She is a skilled art restorer and a passionate professor. She worked many times with Schiaparelli in the past and she likes riddles.
240
The librarian says, "Hello ma'am, you can borrow any book you want here." 
242
It represents a winged genie made of copper. It almost fell off two weeks ago; it's a miracle that it could be retrieved almost intact and stored here. You notice someone wrote in red: "In sapientia credo." Then, there's the same symbol you saw on the letter: A circle with a wavy diagonal: clearly an O and as S superimposed. Yeck! It's blood!
243
Your father says, "Emilia, you received a telegram. Here it is."
244
It's from Antonia Rivetti: "SYMBOL IDENTIFIED STOP MEET ME AT FIORIO AT 4PM STOP". If you hurry, you can still get there on time!
245
Antonia is sipping a glass of vermouth; she waves a hand and invites you to sit down on a chair next to her.^M^M- Emilia, what can I get you? I like coming here at this time of the day. My treat.^MYou take a bicerin, a local mixture of coffee and chocolate.^M- Well, the game is dangerous; the symbol indicates a secret society, called Orientis Sapientia: many rich and powerful people are affiliated with it. Its doctrine is based on old Masonic codes and Hermes Trismegistus's 'Corpus hermeticum.' A true mess. They dabble with young prostitutes, oriental artefacts and rituals with human blood. No wonder they're interested in Nefertari. I wonder why they chose the sandals, though...^M^MYou shiver, you would prefer avoiding being tied to a sacrificial altar by such individuals.
246
You tell Antonia about Rovelli's murder and what you found on the winged genie of the Mole Antonelliana.^M- Well, it just shows how powerful they are to dare that.^MYou ask her who could possibly be the "Grand Master"^M- I don't know, Emilia, probably someone wealthy and dangerous. I suggest finding the 'Corpus hermeticum' to try breaking the code of your letter. They probably feel overconfident, given how they like drawing their symbol everywhere, and their code may be a simple one.^MYou wonder if the Grand Master is Raligotto? Or Pizzarrotti, maybe? You will try to find out!
247
You board the tram to the door of an elegant villa on the hill of Turin. You pull a handle: a butler comes to open the door. You introduce yourself and he announces you to his master, Vittorio Pizzarrotti:^M- Ah, the famous Emilia Vittorini! Please come in! I dedicated my life to praising beauty and your presence lights up my modest dwelling.^M^MYou see paintings and statues probably rare and expensive, but you didn't appreciate very much the unsolicited compliment. You talk about the art market in Turin and Pizzarrotti is solicitous. No, he hasn't heard anything about Egyptian goods, recently. You thank him and say you don't want to steal more of his time, but your host says,^M- I invited some friends this evening, we are having a pleasant conversation in the lounge, I'm sure my guests would love to meet you. Why won't you join us for a while?^M^MYou feel you can't refuse and you follow him.^M
248
Seven middle-aged men are present in the lounge. They are dressed elegantly and without doubt belong to the upper class. Their conversation concerns books. Pizzarrotti picks up some rare French editions and shows off their precious leather binding, with golden letters. Then, he puts them on a table. They then question you about the Egyptian expedition, but you begin to feel bored. Worse, you feel observed. After a while Pizzarrotti shows a deck of cards, makes you pick one that "magically" appears under another deck, where it wasn't supposed to be. You are not amused: you have already seen those games: cheap conjurer's tricks. At one moment, Pizzarrotti stops and with an inspired voice says,^M- Victor n'est pas un monstre, page 134: go check! And, sure enough, page 134 of the first book of the pile that remained on the table begins like that. You know that trick, too, you learnt it in a (good) book. Then he begins to tell anecdotes about the supposedly magic properties of the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... You feel nauseated and almost sick and after a few minutes you find an excuse to extract yourself from that evening. When you take the tramway back to the Gran Madre you feel relieved.
249
- Hello, I'm looking for the Hermes Trismegistus' 'Corpus Hermeticum.'^M- Of course: please fill out this form... Thank you!^MAfter a while, the librarian comes back with an old book and gives it to you. He smiles and you smile back at him.
250
You search the body and you look at his papers: congratulations, you found Rovelli, slaughtered! You can't justify your presence here: you will not call the police right now; the body will be discovered, anyway.
251
You look at the book. Supposedly written by Hermes Trismegistus, it's full of nonsense in latin about nature, cosmos, gods and humans! But... some pages are missing!
252
The door is locked. There's a combination lock on the door, with four dials numbered from 0 to 20.
253
You try numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3 do not work. Well, it's too simple, indeed. You try 3, 5, 8, 13 and the lock opens, with a puff of steam!
254
Pizzarrotti seemed to be obsessed by the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is given by the sum of the two preceding ones... It's worth a try...
256
You try to move the girders. There is something hidden between them: oh, yes, there's a small fascicule! It must have fallen in there.
257
Fifteen pages torn from an old book, kept together by an amateurish binding. The text is in Latin and is nonsense about knowledge and divination.
258
You have no idea about it.
259
No, thanks. You had enough of Pizzarrotti.
260
Antonia takes the letter, the book and the fascicule.^M- Oh, yes! They match. The code starts in the book and continues on the missing pages...^M^M"Dear Rovelli,^M  the box I want will arrive in Genoa with the Rivania ferry and your company is due to transport them to Turin. Make sure the box with the Queen's sandals remain in Genoa: Raligotto will keep them for a while. The grand master."^M^MEverything seems to be clear, now... If you're lucky, the box is still in Genoa, probably in the Raligotto villa. You are going there, by car, and you are going to find them.^M^MThe password for the third part of the game is SHIBBOLETH LUMASSON
261
The ITA 51 is a small and sporty two cylinder steam car, built by your father's company. It's your car: it's fast and agile and you're an excellent racing driver.
262
It's the villa where you live with your father. Well, to tell the truth, you used to live there until you left for the expedition nine months ago. You think you'll be living on your own again soon.
263
Please indicate in your sentence to whom I am supposed to do that.
264
It's the Palazzo Madama, a medieval castle, with a more recent baroque facade.
265
Turin inhabitants are pragmatic. On a rainy day, you can walk literally for miles, keeping your feet dry with no need for an umbrella.
266
One shop sells fabrics, next to it there is a tailor, a cobbler and a bakery. You don't need anything there.
267
There's a faint smell of freshly baked bread.
268
It's the classic smell of Italian cafÃ©s.
269
They are in polished brass, with pomegranate leaves and flowers.
270
Precious cherry-wood panels adorn the ceiling.
271
The upholstery is creamy-coloured, with small red flowers and pale green leaves.
272
They look comfortable.
273
You don't have the time for this, now.
274
You're going to play the piano once you have found the missing box.
275
It's the opera season of the Teatro Regio. You like it a lot. Your father brought you to see the first performance of Puccini's BohÃ¨me, when you were seventeen years old.
276
It has been a while since the last time you went there. Too bad you can't go now!
277
You are not hungry, now.
278
That palace has a nice brick facade.
279
He's a middle-aged man with bloodshot eyes and yellow teeth. He does not seem to have a friendly attitude, but he's whistling some operatic aria.
280
A bright light spills from it.
281
You are not here to visit the museum.
282
It represents King Carlo Alberto of Savoy, on a horse. It's in bronze, with a green patina.
283
Grassy!
284
An entire section of the library burnt in January. While you were in Egypt, you read in the newspapers about manuscripts lost or damaged during that accident.
285
The librarian is visibly younger than you, probably a student working here to make a bit of cash on the side. You find him cute!
286
It's a robust door, shut.
287
It's not there anymore. It was precariously balanced after the storm and had to be removed.
288
Scaffoldings surround the spire.
289
You know, your father can still give you good hints.
290
Try to meet people, gather information and explore.
291
Everything is a matter of finding the right book, hoping it's complete!
292
It decorates the ceiling.
293
It's a copy of the Victory (or Nike) of Samothrace.
294
The floor is made of polished marble, with a square of green Alps marble, surrounded by octagons of white and green patterns.
295
Small human heads and torsos, in plaster, beautifully made. Presumably, Antonia displays them to her students.
296
The workbench is full of tools for drawing and sculpting.
297
Paintings from contemporary painters embellish the floor. They are chosen with taste.
298
It's a broad river, that becomes even broader during its flow towards the sea.
299
It's a bridge, with five arches and cast iron railings.
300
Your father says, ^M- Glad you came, Emilia. Are you sure you do not want to stay a little longer? Schiaparelli's treasures can wait a few days, after all...^MYou answer that you feel compelled to find the missing box.^M- I understand you only too well, my dear: I can barely sleep when I have something on my mind. By the way, you received a message, this morning. Here it is.^MYou thank him and take the message.
301
Luqsor, August 25th, 1904^M^MMy dearest Emilia,^M  you will probably receive this letter at your arrival in Turin, I hope your journey was comfortable.^MI am writing to you as I am restless: I received offers that were too insistent for my taste. A stranger came to meet me at the Mission and offered an preposterous price for the Queen's sandals. He left only when he discovered that they were already heading towards Turin.^MI am sure the man was sent by someone else: we spoke in Italian, and I wouldn't be surprised to discover that he is an agent for someone in Italy. It's just an impression, but please be careful.^M^M   father Antonio Milieri, Italian Mission in Luqsor^M^MP.S. Francesco and Bolos learnt I was writing this message and wish to send you their greetings.
302
There are many cafes and little shops under the arches. You are not there for them, right now.
303
It's a circular church that can be accessed by a set of steps. Two statues seem to look together towards an indefinite point, below the tramway rails in the middle of the square.
304
You can take the tramway here if you want to go up the hill.
305
It's a clear day and you can see the whole city at your feet, surrounded by a magnificent Alpine frame. You recognise Mount Viso, the Rocciamelone, the Gran Paradiso and Mount Rosa.
306
A faint smoky and musty smell is barely perceptible.
307
You need them, for the car.
308
There's an address on the hill of Turin.
309
- Ah, madam, the Director has left and he is not here.
310
Antonia seems occupied reading a book. You don't want to disturb her: you need to find the Corpus Hermeticum!
311
Write "try" and the name or just four numbers.
400
No. You aren't tired, now.
401
No need to do that now.
407
This is a text adventure game. Read descriptions carefully and type commands such as 'examine bed'. Type "north", "south", ... to move in the desired direction.. Abbreviations are possible "x" for "examine", "l" to "look" (i.e. describe your current location again), "i" for "inventory," "n" for "north" and so on. To quit the game, type "bye". To restart it, type "restart".
505
What cat?
504
Please feel free to continue, if you wish to... I've become immunised to swearing and profanity a long time ago.
518
You'll examine yourself much better with a mirror.
902
Try a more specific action.
910
It's evident the fascicule allows to get the complete text, but better search for a specialist.
914
Not yet, it seems incomplete.
996
I see nothing interesting.
997
You don't smell anything in particular, apart from a barely perceptible scent of lavender, coming from your clothes.
998
You have a strange sensation, almost as if you were becoming lighter and lighter. After a while, everything becomes normal, again.
