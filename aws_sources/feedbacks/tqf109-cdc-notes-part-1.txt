TQF : v1.0.9 : PART.1

CDC notes, mostly highly unimportant:-

1) Hotel room:-

This may be part of the puzzle, but `brochure` implies a larger item than a nice stiff calling-card which can be smeared with grease. To me a brochure in this context would be no smaller than and A4 sheet folded into 3 pages.

It could be `A contact card advertising the hotel` or left as it is with, perhaps, the `x brochure` description along the lines of `A brochure advertising the hotel printed on a contact card made from stiff cardboard`

Perhaps allow `card` as an alias for `brochure` here ?

DB. Yes, it is possible, as "card" is used for Rovelli's address, but you can't have it in your inventory at this point of the game.

2) An oddity with the Hotel clerk after taking a certain route:-

After going S->E->E->S-> to gate and back to via Roma, 
then S->W-> and talking to operator to send message
then N->N-> and talking to employee
then N->E->N-> back to hotel

`talk to clerk` gives the "Your room is already paid... ` message and a normal prompt

(I was expecting another telegram )
so I try to leave by typing S
and I then get the "Ma'am, you received an urgent telgram"... message

DB. Probably the easiest thing is to change slightly the message. Instead of:

The clerk recognises you and waves a hand, saying: "Ma'am, you received an 
urgent telegram!"

I can write:

The clerk waves a hand, saying: "Ma'am, you received an 
urgent telegram!"

as it is the "recognizes you" part that sounds strange if you just talked to him.


3) The `room is paid` message:-
`paying one of the best hotels` --could do with a `for`-> `paying for one of the best hotels`


4) First chat with clerk:-

If you talk to the clerk and got S-> without reading the telegram, you get the `No need to wander...` message for S,E,W directions until, you do read it - I suppose this is deliberate.

DB. Yes. I wanted to be sure you read the message. After all, you don't have anything specific to do before.

5) Archives:-

`Archives employee`  --*maybe* better, not much in it --> `Archive empoyee`


6) In small office:-

`Dustbin` is usually used to decribe a big refuse bin rather than an office one,
`wastebin` might be a better long word, with `bin` as an alias.

DB: Well spot!!! Definitely, wastebin would be a better term.

If you try `write letter` before getting the headed paper, it says
`you need something to write` ... should this be 
`you need something to write on` ?

DB: Ok.


7) Harbour Officer:-

I think there is something funny here... Once I've got the letter in the bin
restored by the emporium clerk I seem to have a problem getting the Officer 
to do his searching... I wander around, talk to everyone, go back... nothing...
then I try the same thing again and it works, so I can get some headed paper.

... maybe I'm accidentally hitting some other trigger in trying to ask everyone
things and wandering about, but I seem to remember wondering why he suddenly got
co-operative way back when playing originally, so I thought I'd mention it.

DB: You get the idea of stealing the headed paper by looking at the officer table. However, I noticed the game did not recognize "take headed paper" when the officer is away, but just "take paper". The reason was that the term HEADED was mistakenly recognized with a wrong code.
