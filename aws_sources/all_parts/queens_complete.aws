You are in an elegantly decorated room. The bed is unmade as you slept there last night. A cast iron radiator is on the west wall and a gas chandelier hangs from the white ceiling. The walls of the room are covered by tapestries with flowery patterns painted in delicate colours; a wool carpet covers the floor. A washbowl and a pitcher containing water are placed in front of a large mirror to the north. A gentle morning light spills through a window to the east.

You are in a hydraulic elevator, closed by a finely decorated metal door. There is a curious smell: you'd say that the mechanism has been lubricated recently or it leaks fluid, somewhere. A polished panel with buttons permits you to go down, to the first floor.

You are at the reception of the Grand Hotel Isotta. A panel informs you that you can buy train tickets here. A hydraulic elevator nearby leads to the upper floors, where the rooms for guests are located. Large windows allow a beautiful view of Via Roma and let the morning light shine gently through white taffeta curtains. This place is cosy and decorated with taste.

You are in one of the most important telegraph stations of the city of Genoa, hosted in this splendid palace. You see a classic receiver station installed behind a desk: a telegraphic receiver with a roll of paper activated by a spring, a selector with brass plugs and a telegraphic key. You can read the manufacturer's mark "Balocco & Ghioni, Genoa." Those things fascinate you.

Although hard to believe, there are more skulls piled up within these walls than in previous rooms. Something terrible happened in the past. Probably a plague, centuries ago, ravaged this area and the bodies of the victims were dumped down here.

This chamber continues the hellish theme and you have to walk on a floor completely covered by remains of human beings. You see hundreds of skulls and they seem to silently scream at the frail light of your lamp.

Today is August 27th, 1904. Nine months ago, you, Emilia Vittorini, joined the Italian Archeological Expedition in Egypt led by Ernesto Schiaparelli, the director of the Egyptian Museum of Turin. You are now back in Genoa, Italy: your steam ferry arrived three days ago with 25 wooden boxes containing Queen Nefertari Meritmut's grave goods, a real treasure! They left Genoa by train, heading towards Turin, yesterday evening. While they were in transit, you were invited to a sumptuous reception organised by a wealthy art lover, Eugenio Collovati, count of Raligotto, but it would be hard to say that you appreciated the evening.^M^MBut the reception was yesterday: now, you must catch the train to Turin and check that the treasure arrived safely. I will be your eyes and ears. Good luck.^M^MPasswords are given at the most important moments, write them down. Type 'help' for instructions.

The journey from Genoa to Turin took six hours and you slept for a while. You spent the rest of the time watching the landscape fleeing outside the window of your compartment, lost in your thoughts, until the train arrived at the Porta Nuova station, in Turin. You walked towards your home, to meet your father and your cat (the latter hungry, as usual). They were enthusiastic to meet you again, but you are not resting for a long time: you are now determined to find Rovelli and decipher the letter you discovered in Genoa.

You came to Genoa in the ITA 51. The journey in the evening was a little adventure on its own, but the car is fast and reliable and you were able to complete it with no accidents. Now it's about 10 o'clock and the sky is dark.

MESSAGGI
1
In the mirror you see a young woman, about 5 ft 6 in tall, with blue eyes. That's you. Nine months under the Egyptian sun working at the excavation left a nice tan on your skin. Your hair, naturally red-brownish, became almost blonde.
2
Certainly, it was a very comfortable bed.
3
No. You are leaving your room. The sheets will be changed anyway.
4
You see Via Roma, in Genoa, outside.
5
Flowers and laurel leaves: decorative, indeed!
6
It's a modern cast-iron radiator, with thin feet and ornate geometric patterns. It's cool now, as it's summer.
7
You already washed yourself and you are now wearing your clothes.
8
It has five burners, decorated with brass laurel leaves. Now it's off, but yesterday evening you noticed the light coming from the thorium mantles was particularly bright.
9
There's a faint metallic odour mixed with the familiar smell of the gas burning.
10
From the smell only, you can't recognise if it's lubricating oil or hydraulic fluid.
11
The clerk smiles and asks your name. When you respond, he says "Madam, we received a telegram for you this morning. Here it is." You thank him politely and put the telegram in your pocket.
12
"Your room is already fully paid up, Madam." That's true, Raligotto insisted on paying for one of the best hotels in the city for you.
13
It's an urgent telegram from Schiaparelli, the director of the Egyptian Museum. He is in Turin, now: "TRAIN ARRIVED STOP ONE BOX MISSING STOP QUEENS SANDALS STOP." You almost scream while reading this: a box has been stolen! You feel angry: you knew that you shouldn't have gone to that stupid reception and should have stayed with the boxes! You decide to remain in Genoa for the moment, trying to understand what happened.
14
You send an urgent telegram to Schiaparelli "ALL BOXES PRESENT IN FERRY STOP MAYBE STOLEN FROM TRAIN STOP I INVESTIGATE STOP", that's three one-lira silver pieces. The operator then sits at the telegraphic station, puts her hand on the Forcieri key mechanism and starts tapping. She returns to say that the message has been sent.
15
You have a look in the wastebin. Among other documents, you see a strange sheet of paper, maybe a letter, torn in pieces.
16
^MWhile you're walking down the street, you hear a car approaching rapidly behind you. Your reflexes make you swiftly jump to one side and you avoid it, barely. The car speeds away from you. While you feel your heart pounding, you say to yourself that it's better to stay alert: you are not sure this was an accident. You read the plate though: it was something similar to GE240 or GE340.
17
You approach the man and ask him about the plate of the car that almost ran you down: "I couldn't possibly tell you that, young lady! We can't just give out information like that to anybody that walks in here. We need an official order for that!" I will not describe what you think: the game would be rated adult-only...
18
The employee must be more or less your age, but has an unpleasant expression on his face.
19
No need to wander in the city; you're not here as a tourist. Better stay close to the hotel.
20
The emporium clerk is a thin old lady with white hair and a lively stare. She has probably worked here for the last 50 years.
21
You ask the clerk if she has something to hold together pieces of paper. She searches in a box and after a while she hands you a roll of gum paper. It cost 10 cents.
22
It's a thick wool carpet. It helps to keep the place warm in winter time, but walking on it is pleasing in summer, too.
23
Brassy!
24
They're clean.
25
It's walnut hardwood.
26
It does not produce much light.
27
The door mechanism oozes a little bit of grease.
28
You can't take the grease with your bare hands. That would be very messy!
29
It's now greasy and slippery.
30
You use the brochure to take a little bit of grease from the floor, close to the door.
31
The brochure is not slippery enough to slide in the gap.
32
Someone from maintenance was a little overzealous greasing the door!
33
It's a large wrought-iron gate, topped with polished brass decorations. On one of them, you see a strange symbol composed of a stretched oval, a sort of an "O" with a wavy line placed diagonally from top left to bottom right.
34
You have already seen that symbol! On the gate of Raligotto's villa. Maybe there is a connection: you should find someone that can help you decipher the letter!
36
It's a description of the various services offered by the Grand Hotel Isotta on a small piece of cardboard, relatively rigid. It's truly a luxurious hotel! You can even buy train tickets there. Raligotto generously paid for your room.
40
The hotel clerk is a young man, relatively tall, smiling in a professional way.
41
The telegraph operator is an approximately 40 year old lady, dressed in the uniform of the Italian Royal Mail.
44
The sheet is torn in small pieces. You may recompose it but you need something to keep them together.
45
It's a sort of puzzle, but you are good at those things: you used the gum paper to hold the pieces together and it works. The letter is now readable, and says "Turin, August 20, 1904. Dear Rovelli, 88 43 23..." and a series of numbers. It's a code! This sounds weird... The letter is signed "Grand Master" followed a symbol with an O and a wavy sign, a sort of an S inside.
46
It's a rather ordinary front office you'd expect to find in administrative places: headed paper, an official stamp with the appropriate ink, etc...
47
This gives you an idea...
48
Thinking fast, you say: "Good morning, sir, I am looking for the exact arrival time of the ferry "Rivania" on which I came here two days ago. I would like to insure some goods and my insurance needs it. Could you please look it up for me?" The officer pompously says to wait a few minutes and goes searching in the archives. You need to move fast!
49
The harbour officer has come back and says "Madam, your ferry berthed here at the harbour on August 24, at 17:32 precisely." You thank him, smiling.
50
You can't touch it while the officer is present!
51
You rapidly take a sheet of headed paper and stamp it twice. That will do. You still have to write something on it, but you will do that later.
52
You write an elegantly handwritten note on the stamped headed paper, saying that you are authorized to access reserved information in the archives such as the attribution of license plates. With a flourish you add several fake signatures.
53
The officer is a young lad. He looks overly proud of his uniform.
54
You'd need something to write...
55
The employee takes the order and examines it carefully... "Well... it seems that everything is in order." He goes away and comes back with a register: it's the list of the registered car plates in Genoa. You have a look at it... it was GE240 or GE340. It's easy: GE340 is not attributed yet: GE240 Rovelli Antonio, P.za Acquaverde 12. The employee writes the address on a card that he gives to you.
56
The clerk waves a hand, saying: "Ma'am, you received an urgent telegram!" and gives it to you. You read it immediately: Schiaparelli answered your message with "FIND ROVELLI STOP CHIEF OF FREIGHT TRAIN TRANSFER COMPANY STOP".
57
^MYou stop and think... there are a few things that point towards a certain Rovelli: Schiaparelli's message, the coded letter and the plate of the car that tried to run you over. That can't be a coincidence. Rovelli is now in Turin, apparently. You must find out who the "Grand Master" is and what that strange symbol means. You can probably find someone in Turin that can decipher the letter. You decide to go there as soon as possible!
58
The door, which opens inwards, is locked.
59
You slide the brochure in the gap between the door and the jamb, reaching the latch. A more elastic and flexible material than the cardboard would be better at this kind of job, but it's an old lock and it does not resist you long. You move the latch and open the door.
60
You need more than a pretty ordinary door to stop you!
61
You buy train tickets to Turin and thank the clerk. While you walk towards the Piazza Principe train station you think that there are strange things moving around this story and you are now more than ever determined to find the missing box. On another hand, you're happy to come home, to see your family. You catch your train and, rocked by the wagon movements, you rapidly fall asleep; your last thought was a pleasant one: you are going to see Democrito, your cat, real soon!
62
^MYou reached the second part of the game. You can use 'SHIBBOLETH FANFALUCH' to access it.^M
63
You find number 12 and stride in. There is a doorman and you ask him cautiously about Rovelli: "He's not here! I saw him leaving hurriedly two hours ago, saying he had to go to Turin." You thank him and exit the building. So... Rovelli is going to Turin?
64
You hear a faint ringing sound, yet nobody comes to the gate.
65
It's a tall column, with a statue of Christopher Columbus on the top, pointing towards the sea with his hand.
66
You turn your face towards the sun, closing your eyes. You can feel its gentle warmth on your skin.
67
Train tickets available: Turin La Spezia, Pisa (P.za Principe) special trains for Chiavari (P.za Brignole)
68
It's a modern, efficient, hydraulic elevator. The steam engine that pressurises the fluid must be in the back yard.
69
The shops mainly sell luxury items: not relevant for what you're trying to do.
70
A modern steam tramway passes here every 10 minutes.
71
Those are horse chestnuts.
72
The air smells of iodine and salt, with a faint fishy undertone. You breathe it in voluptuously.
73
Raligotto in person made you visit his park yesterday evening. The park was beautiful, but your host was pompous and vacuous.
74
Many of the buildings are occupied by banks. Economic activities are common, here!
75
It represents Giuseppe Garibaldi, riding a horse.
76
Many lines of the steam tramway pass through here.
77
The square is paved with porphyry stones.
78
There is a pressurised air line that goes towards the villa. When you pull the handle you vent it, the pressure drops and this rings the bell by letting a small hammer fall on it. You saw the mechanism yesterday evening.
79
The receiver writes dots and dashes on a long ribbon of paper.
80
The key is a switch that closes a circuit, allowing the telegraph to work.
81
The selector allows the operator to connect or disconnect the receiver and the key, or even to ground the line, by moving the brass plugs.
82
Those are simple plugs, an inch long, used in the selector.
83
It's a long paper ribbon. On one side of the receiver it is blank, neatly rolled into a reel. On the other side it is collected into a bin and it is covered by dots and dashes traced with a purple ink.
84
It's an ordinary desk, meant to receive clients.
85
It's a large brick palace, built during the Middle Ages.
86
This place has an interesting smell that mixes salty air with cinnamon, fish, coffee and chickpea bread (by the way, you tasted it when you first arrived in Genoa and you really loved it).
87
The booths sell fish and street food, as well as spices. You are not hungry, now.
88
They sell many things, rather uninteresting for you. However, you notice a small emporium to the south.
89
For sure, it's a long porch!.
92
Examine carefully every object. Talk with people. Smell. Draw a map.
93
A closed door will not stop Emilia, if equipped with a (slippery) card.
94
It's a small office, dedicated to administrative tasks.
95
Those rails allow yard workers to load goods directly on a freight train. Smart!
96
No. That would spill ink everywhere!
97
It's a goose quill and a moderate quantity of blue ink.
98
On the desk, there are dossiers registering the goods loaded here during the last week. Like the others, our missing box's destination is recorded as Turin.
99
It's a large facade with an arch supported by six columns. Marble statues decorate it.
100
Flowery!
101
Salty water and fish with a scent of coal smoke.
102
Everything you need for your morning toilette.
103
Please specify where to put the brochure.
104
It reads "GE240 Rovelli Antonio, P.za Acquaverde 12." It is worth a visit...
105
It looks official!
106
Find something to say, first...
107
Talk to the clerk.
108
Use 'bye' if you want to stop playing.
109
"My pleasure, Madam."
110
Large houses and building are around the place, they have a number on a plate.
231
You may try that, but it will probably not work.
232
You caress Democrito, your cat. He seems enthusiastic to see you!
233
He's your pet, a Siamese tabby mix and is extremely gentle. He is a relatively small cat, but with soft long hair.
234
Your father is a middle-aged man, relatively tall and with bright eyes.  Ten years ago with his brother he founded a steam car company, called ITA, i.e. Industria Torinese Automobili. He is a mechanical genius and a cultivated man.
235
You cheer up Temistocle. He's prickly to strangers, but he knows you well: ^M- Ah, Emilia, you came back! Come with me, Director Schiaparelli is so worried.^MYou follow him and he lets you in to Schiaparelli's office. He is working at his desk: ^M- Oh, good grief, my dear Emilia, the sandals are the most important finding of the grave...^M^MYou have a long talk. Schiaparelli suspects the freight company and in particular Rovelli.^M^M- Maybe we can find the sandals in the art market. They are extremely valuable! You can ask Vittorio Pizzarrotti about that: he lives in a villa on the hill of Turin and he is an art dealer and a patron of considerable renown. Here's his calling card.
236
You show the letter to your father. He says, "It's a code! Go see Antonia Rivetti, you remember her? She now works at the Accademia Albertina; she will be glad to help you."
237
No reason to do that.
238
You knock on the door and enter Antonia's office.^M^M- Madam, I'm Emilia Vittorini.^M- Emilia? Last time I saw you you were a kid. What brings you here?^M^MYou explain briefly the situation and show her the letter.^M^M- Aha! A cipher-book code. You need a book and you number each word progressively. You then associate a progressive number to the first letter of each word and you use that to encode your text. You need to know the book used for that, it's the key. The symbol on the other hand reminds me of something... I'll do some research and I'll let you know.^M^MYou thank her warmly and you continue chatting for a while!
239
Antonia is about 40 year old: she is a true beauty, just as you remembered. She is a skilled art restorer and a passionate professor. She worked many times with Schiaparelli in the past and she likes riddles.
240
The librarian says, "Hello ma'am, you can borrow any book you want here." 
242
It represents a winged genie made of copper. It almost fell off two weeks ago; it's a miracle that it could be retrieved almost intact and stored here. You notice someone wrote in red: "In sapientia credo." Then, there's the same symbol you saw on the letter: A circle with a wavy diagonal: clearly an O and as S superimposed. Yeck! It's blood!
243
Your father says, "Emilia, you received a telegram. Here it is."
244
It's from Antonia Rivetti: "SYMBOL IDENTIFIED STOP MEET ME AT FIORIO AT 4PM STOP". If you hurry, you can still get there on time!
245
Antonia is sipping a glass of vermouth; she waves a hand and invites you to sit down on a chair next to her.^M^M- Emilia, what can I get you? I like coming here at this time of the day. My treat.^MYou take a bicerin, a local mixture of coffee and chocolate.^M- Well, the game is dangerous; the symbol indicates a secret society, called Orientis Sapientia: many rich and powerful people are affiliated with it. Its doctrine is based on old Masonic codes and Hermes Trismegistus's 'Corpus hermeticum.' A true mess. They dabble with young prostitutes, oriental artefacts and rituals with human blood. No wonder they're interested in Nefertari. I wonder why they chose the sandals, though...^M^MYou shiver, you would prefer avoiding being tied to a sacrificial altar by such individuals.
246
You tell Antonia about Rovelli's murder and what you found on the winged genie of the Mole Antonelliana.^M- Well, it just shows how powerful they are to dare that.^MYou ask her who could possibly be the "Grand Master"^M- I don't know, Emilia, probably someone wealthy and dangerous. I suggest finding the 'Corpus hermeticum' to try breaking the code of your letter. They probably feel overconfident, given how they like drawing their symbol everywhere, and their code may be a simple one.^MYou wonder if the Grand Master is Raligotto? Or Pizzarrotti, maybe? You will try to find out!
247
You board the tram to the door of an elegant villa on the hill of Turin. You pull a handle: a butler comes to open the door. You introduce yourself and he announces you to his master, Vittorio Pizzarrotti:^M- Ah, the famous Emilia Vittorini! Please come in! I dedicated my life to praising beauty and your presence lights up my modest dwelling.^M^MYou see paintings and statues probably rare and expensive, but you didn't appreciate very much the unsolicited compliment. You talk about the art market in Turin and Pizzarrotti is solicitous. No, he hasn't heard anything about Egyptian goods, recently. You thank him and say you don't want to steal more of his time, but your host says,^M- I invited some friends this evening, we are having a pleasant conversation in the lounge, I'm sure my guests would love to meet you. Why won't you join us for a while?^M^MYou feel you can't refuse and you follow him.^M
248
Seven middle-aged men are present in the lounge. They are dressed elegantly and without doubt belong to the upper class. Their conversation concerns books. Pizzarrotti picks up some rare French editions and shows off their precious leather binding, with golden letters. Then, he puts them on a table. They then question you about the Egyptian expedition, but you begin to feel bored. Worse, you feel observed. After a while Pizzarrotti shows a deck of cards, makes you pick one that "magically" appears under another deck, where it wasn't supposed to be. You are not amused: you have already seen those games: cheap conjurer's tricks. At one moment, Pizzarrotti stops and with an inspired voice says,^M- Victor n'est pas un monstre, page 134: go check! And, sure enough, page 134 of the first book of the pile that remained on the table begins like that. You know that trick, too, you learnt it in a (good) book. Then he begins to tell anecdotes about the supposedly magic properties of the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... You feel nauseated and almost sick and after a few minutes you find an excuse to extract yourself from that evening. When you take the tramway back to the Gran Madre you feel relieved.
249
- Hello, I'm looking for the Hermes Trismegistus' 'Corpus Hermeticum.'^M- Of course: please fill out this form... Thank you!^MAfter a while, the librarian comes back with an old book and gives it to you. He smiles and you smile back at him.
250
You search the body and you look at his papers: congratulations, you found Rovelli, slaughtered! You can't justify your presence here: you will not call the police right now; the body will be discovered, anyway.
251
You look at the book. Supposedly written by Hermes Trismegistus, it's full of nonsense in latin about nature, cosmos, gods and humans! But... some pages are missing!
252
The door is locked. There's a combination lock on the door, with four dials numbered from 0 to 20.
253
You try numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3 do not work. Well, it's too simple, indeed. You try 3, 5, 8, 13 and the lock opens, with a puff of steam!
254
Pizzarrotti seemed to be obsessed by the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is given by the sum of the two preceding ones... It's worth a try...
256
You try to move the girders. There is something hidden between them: oh, yes, there's a small fascicule! It must have fallen in there.
257
Fifteen pages torn from an old book, kept together by an amateurish binding. The text is in Latin and is nonsense about knowledge and divination.
258
You have no idea about it.
259
No, thanks. You had enough of Pizzarrotti.
260
Antonia takes the letter, the book and the fascicule.^M- Oh, yes! They match. The code starts in the book and continues on the missing pages...^M^M"Dear Rovelli,^M  the box I want will arrive in Genoa with the Rivania ferry and your company is due to transport them to Turin. Make sure the box with the Queen's sandals remain in Genoa: Raligotto will keep them for a while. The grand master."^M^MEverything seems to be clear, now... If you're lucky, the box is still in Genoa, probably in the Raligotto villa. You are going there, by car, and you are going to find them.^M^MThe password for the third part of the game is SHIBBOLETH LUMASSON
261
The ITA 51 is a small and sporty two cylinder steam car, built by your father's company. It's your car: it's fast and agile and you're an excellent racing driver.
262
It's the villa where you live with your father. Well, to tell the truth, you used to live there until you left for the expedition nine months ago. You think you'll be living on your own again soon.
263
Please indicate in your sentence to whom I am supposed to do that.
264
It's the Palazzo Madama, a medieval castle, with a more recent baroque facade.
265
Turin inhabitants are pragmatic. On a rainy day, you can walk literally for miles, keeping your feet dry with no need for an umbrella.
266
One shop sells fabrics, next to it there is a tailor, a cobbler and a bakery. You don't need anything there.
267
There's a faint smell of freshly baked bread.
268
It's the classic smell of Italian caf√©s.
269
They are in polished brass, with pomegranate leaves and flowers.
270
Precious cherry-wood panels adorn the ceiling.
271
The upholstery is creamy-coloured, with small red flowers and pale green leaves.
272
They look comfortable.
273
You don't have the time for this, now.
274
You're going to play the piano once you have found the missing box.
275
It's the opera season of the Teatro Regio. You like it a lot. Your father brought you to see the first performance of Puccini's Boh√®me, when you were seventeen years old.
276
It has been a while since the last time you went there. Too bad you can't go now!
277
You are not hungry, now.
278
That palace has a nice brick facade.
279
He's a middle-aged man with bloodshot eyes and yellow teeth. He does not seem to have a friendly attitude, but he's whistling some operatic aria.
280
A bright light spills from it.
281
You are not here to visit the museum.
282
It represents King Carlo Alberto of Savoy, on a horse. It's in bronze, with a green patina.
283
Grassy!
284
An entire section of the library burnt in January. While you were in Egypt, you read in the newspapers about manuscripts lost or damaged during that accident.
285
The librarian is visibly younger than you, probably a student working here to make a bit of cash on the side. You find him cute!
286
It's a robust door, shut.
287
It's not there anymore. It was precariously balanced after the storm and had to be removed.
288
Scaffoldings surround the spire.
289
You know, your father can still give you good hints.
290
Try to meet people, gather information and explore.
291
Everything is a matter of finding the right book, hoping it's complete!
292
It decorates the ceiling.
293
It's a copy of the Victory (or Nike) of Samothrace.
294
The floor is made of polished marble, with a square of green Alps marble, surrounded by octagons of white and green patterns.
295
Small human heads and torsos, in plaster, beautifully made. Presumably, Antonia displays them to her students.
296
The workbench is full of tools for drawing and sculpting.
297
Paintings from contemporary painters embellish the floor. They are chosen with taste.
298
It's a broad river, that becomes even broader during its flow towards the sea.
299
It's a bridge, with five arches and cast iron railings.
300
Your father says, ^M- Glad you came, Emilia. Are you sure you do not want to stay a little longer? Schiaparelli's treasures can wait a few days, after all...^MYou answer that you feel compelled to find the missing box.^M- I understand you only too well, my dear: I can barely sleep when I have something on my mind. By the way, you received a message, this morning. Here it is.^MYou thank him and take the message.
301
Luqsor, August 25th, 1904^M^MMy dearest Emilia,^M  you will probably receive this letter at your arrival in Turin, I hope your journey was comfortable.^MI am writing to you as I am restless: I received offers that were too insistent for my taste. A stranger came to meet me at the Mission and offered an preposterous price for the Queen's sandals. He left only when he discovered that they were already heading towards Turin.^MI am sure the man was sent by someone else: we spoke in Italian, and I wouldn't be surprised to discover that he is an agent for someone in Italy. It's just an impression, but please be careful.^M^M   father Antonio Milieri, Italian Mission in Luqsor^M^MP.S. Francesco and Bolos learnt I was writing this message and wish to send you their greetings.
302
There are many cafes and little shops under the arches. You are not there for them, right now.
303
It's a circular church that can be accessed by a set of steps. Two statues seem to look together towards an indefinite point, below the tramway rails in the middle of the square.
304
You can take the tramway here if you want to go up the hill.
305
It's a clear day and you can see the whole city at your feet, surrounded by a magnificent Alpine frame. You recognise Mount Viso, the Rocciamelone, the Gran Paradiso and Mount Rosa.
306
A faint smoky and musty smell is barely perceptible.
307
You need them, for the car.
308
There's an address on the hill of Turin.
309
- Ah, madam, the Director has left and he is not here.
310
Antonia seems occupied reading a book. You don't want to disturb her: you need to find the Corpus Hermeticum!
311
Write "try" and the name or just four numbers.
400
No. You aren't tired, now.
401
No need to do that now.
402
No. It may be dangerous.
407
This is a text adventure game. Read descriptions carefully and type commands such as 'examine bed'. Type "north", "south", ... to move in the desired direction.. Abbreviations are possible "x" for "examine", "l" to "look" (i.e. describe your current location again), "i" for "inventory," "n" for "north" and so on. To quit the game, type "bye". To restart it, type "restart".
504
Please feel free to continue, if you wish to... I've become immunised to swearing and profanity a long time ago.
505
What cat?
518
You'll examine yourself much better with a mirror.
600
And potentially face a dangerous member of a secret society? No, thanks!
601
I can't move in the dark!
602
It's an acetylene lamp, a Moissan model, made in France. Water on carbide generates acetylene that burns with a bright white flame.
603
It's an acetylene lamp, a Moissan model, made in France. It's off, but you have matches and carbide and the reservoir is full of water.
604
You open the valve and the water drips on the block of carbide. The acetylene exits the burner with an acrid smell. You ignite it with a match, and a vivid flame is produced.
605
You close the valve and the water stops dripping. The lamp is now off.
606
You hit the wall with the crowbar and you are able to demolish it. It was not very solid, after all!
607
The south wall is not complete. Bricks are missing under the ceiling, and air flows through the gap. There's a cavity on the other side!
608
The smell is awful: damp, sewage and mold.
609
It's covered by rust, but it's still solid.
610
It has been left there for at least 50 years. There are old rags, eaten by rats. A wooden box nonetheless contains a crowbar.
611
It's a pile of garbage. Nothing of interest.
612
It's a strong iron grate, allowing the water to flow away.
613
A corner of the square is cordoned off. There's a wooden box next to an open manhole.
614
There is a box containing some tools. Apparently, something is being repaired underground: there's an open manhole.
615
The box contains an acetylene lamp and a long rope.
616
With your bare hands? Killing a dragon would be easier!
617
Thousands of bodies have been piled up here, hundreds of years ago. As you explore this place, your very being fills with horror.
618
It's a machine, with exposed gears moved by a brass crank. It probably controls water drainage, but it has not been used for decades.
619
After a while, the crank slowly moves, and you feel the machine pushing a heavy object such as a bulkhead somewhere else. You hear the sound of water flushing away.
620
You push with all your might, but it does not move.
621
It's an old oil lantern, broken. It contains a little bit of rancid oil.
622
You pour oil from the lantern on the wheels of the machine. It should help!
623
It's full of water.
624
There is probably a chamber at the bottom of the pit.
625
You tie the rope to the grate and you drop the other end in the pit. It will support your weight.
626
No, that may be useful like that.
627
Ick! The floor is crawling with rats. You will not set foot in there unless you  unless you will find a way to repel those vermin.
628
You set fire to the stick with the acetylene lamp. Now you have a flaming torch in your hand.
629
The light from your lamp is enough, but the torch will last for a while.
630
You throw the torch and it falls on the floor of the room to the east. All the rats run away, scared by the fire.
631
No! The rats may come back.
632
No. It will only last for a few seconds.
633
You poke the glob of grease with the stick. It's slimy and it impregnates the wood. Ick!
634
Hell, no! Not with your bare hands.
635
It's a disgusting blob of grease attached to the wall of the channel, probably formed by oils and greases of the sewer.
636
You turn off your lamp, so as not to be seen by the people in the chamber, which is faintly illuminated by candles. Ten masked figures stand around a large pentagon. An altar is placed in the centre of the pentagon and carries the Queen's sandals. The contents of the stolen box! At the side of the room, ten young women, each dressed in a light linen garment, stand almost in a trance. Close to the altar, a masked priest intones "Oh most beautiful Nefertari Meritmut, Queen of the ancient ages, come with us and show us the truth. Your sandals will find the path and we will follow your footsteps. The fountain that can not be drained will spring in our souls; we will to drink of its liquor that does not inebriate..." You recognise his voice: Raligotto! Then, a puff of steam escapes from under the altar and a mist falls on the bystanders.
637
The ceremonial lasts for a few minutes. Some tricks like the steam are meant to show the "materialisation" of Nefertari. Raligotto continues to recite spells and formulae, but you are not impressed at all. At the end, each girl takes a masked man by the hand, and they drift away. You remain alone, watching the large room, now empty.
638
^MYou hear a flushing noise. You turn on your lamp and run towards the cistern, but you find that water has again invaded the path from whence you came. You come back, blocked in this catacomb: the torch is going out and the rats will return in a few minutes!
639
The walls are covered in marble paneling.
640
You knock everywhere. The west wall sounds empty.
641
You push the west wall with all your might. One marble panel slides, revealing a passage.
642
The flame is extinguishing. Think fast!
643
^MWhile you push yourself into the tight gap, leaving behind this nightmarish room, the torch goes out. You hear the rats invading the floor, but you escaped on time.
644
They are decorated lavishly, but the light is feeble.
645
Many people came here, this evening...
646
Putrid and smelly water flows there.
647
It's a drinking water pipe.
648
It's a robust iron grate. Water goes through it, but you definitely can't.
649
Use the force, Emilia!
650
The walls are made of bricks, with saline encrustations, old spider webs and mould stains.
651
You know, a round hole in the ground that you can pass through... It has no cover, though.
652
It will support your weight.
653
A concrete slab.
654
The water must be calcareous here.
655
Stone-y!
656
It's an iron grate, a drain for water, solidly attached to the wall.
657
It's a long and robust rope.
658
It's a long and robust rope, solidly tied to the grate.
659
There is a lot of dust, but no footprints are visible except your own.
660
Someone likely stayed here for a long time. He or she wrote several numbers on the wall, with the smoke of a flame, probably counting the days.
661
This place was probably used as a reservoir, many years ago, hence the mechanism to control the water flow.
662
It's the very fine mud left by water sedimentation.
663
Those are drain holes: there are five of them. They are too small to get through. Not that you want to, anyway...
664
They are white and remarkably uninteresting.
665
You learnt how to climb on such things some years ago.
666
It requires a certain skill to build a ceiling like that!
667
The password for the final part of the game is SHIBBOLETH BRUTCOMALANEUIT.
668
Old artefacts require care.
669
Prometheus' fate was a terrible one, but he gifted us interesting things.
670
You found them! Queen Nefertari's sandals, one of her most precious grave goods.
671
You see a chamber behind the grate, with candles forming a pentagon in the centre of the room. A stone altar is in the middle of it.
672
Candles were lit during the ceremony you saw from the grate and the pentagon is one of the symbols revered by occultists. It's suggestive, but you suspect the bystanders were more interested in the girls. 
673
You think you know from whence they come. There is the symbol with the O and S carved in their front.
674
You evidently stand behind a concealed door, heavy and controlled by a strange mechanism. A large piston pushes the door against the wall, and pipes carry steam to it. There's a lever on the right-hand side.
675
You pull the lever, but steam escapes from a punctured pipe into your face. You have to release the lever and step away.
676
The goggles protect you from the steam blown in your face; the pressure is not excessive and you are not burnt. When the pressure is relieved, the heavy door opens, very silently.
677
It's locked.
678
You're not leaving without the Queen's sandals!
679
It's open.
680
Nothing happens.
681
You hear two voices in the nearby salon:^M^M- Where are your guests?^M- Upstairs, with the girls.^M^MYou recognize Pizzarrotti and Raligotto. Pizzarrotti is very angry:^M^M- You are a chump: why did you hire an assassin to kill Rovelli? He couldn't be more idiotic, he chased him into the Mole Antonelliana and he left our sign made with his blood so that now all the police in the north of Italy are after us.^M- He threatened me! Didn't you think that the reason he went to Turin was to extort money from you too? I did you a favor!^M- You are a rotten little nobleman trying to make a name for yourself, asking for money for your clumsy staged ceremonies; you are a good-for-nothing, able only to piss away your father's fortune! I am trying to save everything and I find you with your acolytes, blinded by alcohol and sex, not realising that there are things so much bigger at play.^M^MThey are arguing! You'd better get out of here immediately!
682
Just after you pass through it, the secret door closes itself again.
683
You are on the ground floor: you can jump outside.
684
You jump outside and run across the villa's grounds lit by the moon. You find a place where you can climb the fence. When you touch the ground outside, you see many cars with a siren approaching: it's the police! You walk away, un-noticed. You return to Turin in the middle of the night to meet Schiaparelli, who is relieved to see the sandals again. The police would have kept them for years waiting for the trial. You could finally go home to your villa to rest.
685
You wake up in your bedroom. Your father made breakfast (it would be better to say lunch) for you in the salon, along with a copy of La Stampa, the local newspaper. On the first page is a headline with a short article:^M^M"MURDER IN THE MOLE ANTONELLIANA: SECRET CRIME SOCIETY DISMANTLED: Orientis Sapientia, a secret society recruiting in the high society of several cities of the north of Italy has been discovered and many of its members have been arrested in a coordinated Police action between Turin, Genoa and Milan. The society is suspected in thefts of many works of art and to have ordered the murder of Antonio Rovelli, whose dead body was discovered in the Tempietto of the Mole Antonelliana yesterday."^M^MThe article then describes the rituals and the prostitutes, but you know the story. Nothing is said about the Queen's sandals, and that is a good thing for you.^M^MFinal code word: LANEUITAPORTACUNSEI!^M^MThanks for playing this game!
686
It's a stone altar covered by a scarlet tablecloth.
687
You know where the door is, but it is now invisible. There is probably a hidden lever to open it.
688
There are many precious books.
689
The window is locked.
690
It's in brass, with laurel leaves.
691
Nice red velvet lining.
692
It's a large desk, in mahogany.
693
It's night, outside.
694
It's an old wooden stick, eaten by woodworm.
695
It's an old wooden stick, impregnated with grease.
696
It burns well. You can throw it to scare rats.
697
Matches: they ignite things.
698
"Let me see. Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy." Better let those bones rest in peace...
699
Walls may not be as they seem.
700
Protection is the key.
701
You don't need that anymore.
703
Be more precise. I don't think you mean on the floor!
704
No. It would spill everywhere.
705
Not now, you hear voices nearby. Their conversation is probably interesting.
900
You can buy small things.
901
No, use them to buy things, instead.
902
Try a more specific action.
904
You discuss with the clerk: you ask for something to write, but she only has black ink and you know the one used in official orders is blue. You will have to find it elsewhere!
905
Talk with the clerk to buy things.
906
No, you are here to find the sandals!
907
Certainly Raligotto loves incense!
908
No, too many people are around.
909
Too noisy! Try with your hands.
910
It's evident the fascicule allows to get the complete text, but better search for a specialist.
911
You try to rub the stick on the mechanism, but the grease is not fluid enough to penetrate through the gears.
912
No. You think it will be useful.
913
You'd need something to write on...
914
Not yet, it seems incomplete.
996
I see nothing interesting.
997
You don't smell anything in particular, apart from a barely perceptible scent of lavender, coming from your clothes.
998
You have a strange sensation, almost as if you were becoming lighter and lighter. After a while, everything becomes normal, again.
1000
Okay.
1001
Done.
1002
Done.
1003
You're already carrying too much!
1004
It's too big to be carried!
1005
You can't take that!
1006
You can't do that!
1007
You don't have that with you!
1008
You can't go that way!
1009
I beg your pardon?
1010
You can't.
1011
You already have that with you!
1012
What do you want to do? 
1013
It's dark, you can't see anything.
1018
